# ast-index v3.53.0

Structural, AST-aware code navigation CLI for large, multi-language
repositories. It builds a local SQLite index of symbols, references, imports,
modules, dependencies, and inheritance so humans and agents can move through
code by exact structure instead of grep-style text matches.

https://t.me/defendend_ai_dev

## What It Gives You

- Navigate classes, functions, files, imports, usages, callers, implementations,
  inheritance, modules, and dependency paths.
- Start broad with `explore`, then jump to exact definitions with `symbol`,
  `class`, `outline`, and `refs`.
- Keep the index current with `ast-index update` after the first `rebuild`.
- Give coding agents compact, parseable context instead of raw file dumps.
- Save ~40-50% of agent tokens on large repositories by returning structural
  slices of code instead of whole files.

**Languages:** Kotlin, Java, Swift, Objective-C, TypeScript, JavaScript, Vue,
Svelte, CSS, SCSS, Less, Rust, Zig, C#, Python, Go, C, C++, Scala, PHP, Ruby,
Perl, Dart, Protocol Buffers, WSDL, XSD, BSL (1C:Enterprise), Lua, Bash, Elixir,
SQL, R, Matlab, Groovy, Common Lisp, GDScript. Project type is auto-detected.

## How To

```bash
# Install
brew tap defendend/ast-index
brew install ast-index

# Build an index once per project
cd /path/to/project
ast-index rebuild

# Ask code questions
ast-index explore "payment flow"
ast-index search ViewModel
ast-index class BaseFragment
ast-index usages Repository
ast-index implementations Presenter
ast-index deps app
```

Use `ast-index update` after edits or branch switches. Hooks can queue a
trailing-debounced refresh without losing edits that arrive during an update:

```bash
ast-index update --background --debounce-ms 500
```

Index-reading commands wait (with a bounded timeout) for an already queued
generation, so they do not observe stale results. In monorepos with nested
project markers, add `--walk-up` or `AST_INDEX_WALK_UP=1` to reuse the root
index.

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS/Linux)

```bash
brew tap defendend/ast-index
brew install ast-index
```

### Cargo (crates.io)

Requires a Rust toolchain.

```bash
cargo install ast-index --locked
```

To build the unreleased default branch instead:

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/defendend/Claude-ast-index-search ast-index
```

Both build from source. For prebuilt release binaries, use Homebrew, npm, or Winget.

### Winget (Windows)

```shell
winget install --id defendend.ast-index
```

### Migration from kotlin-index

If you have the old `kotlin-index` installed:

```bash
brew uninstall kotlin-index
brew untap defendend/kotlin-index
brew tap defendend/ast-index
brew install ast-index
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/defendend/Claude-ast-index-search.git
cd Claude-ast-index-search
cargo build --release
# Binary: target/release/ast-index (~44 MB)
```

### Troubleshooting: Syntax errors on install

If `brew install ast-index` fails with merge conflict errors (`<<<<<<< HEAD`), reset your local tap:

```bash
cd /opt/homebrew/Library/Taps/defendend/homebrew-ast-index
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
brew install ast-index
```

## Monorepo Workflow

If your repo has subdirectories with their own VCS markers (git submodules,
subtrees, nested `Cargo.toml` / `settings.gradle`), read-commands normally
stop at the nearest marker — they won't reuse a parent-level index even
if one exists. Pass `--walk-up`, or set `AST_INDEX_WALK_UP=1`, to tell
the lookup to prefer any existing parent DB over nested markers:

```bash
# once, in the root
cd /monorepo && ast-index rebuild

# later, from any subproject — reuse the root index
AST_INDEX_WALK_UP=1 ast-index search ViewModel
# or per-call:
ast-index --walk-up search ViewModel
```

This is opt-in by design: silently preferring a far-away parent DB could
surface a stale or misconfigured index from an earlier accidental
`rebuild` higher up. With the flag you explicitly say "trust the parent".

## Worktrees And Intentional Cross-Root Workspaces

Independent git worktrees get independent indexes because their canonical
root paths differ. Rebuild once inside each worktree; do not attach worktrees
to one another.

For source trees that intentionally form one workspace, create the primary
index first, attach a named subtree, then index the attached files:

```bash
cd /path/to/application
ast-index rebuild
ast-index subtree add shared ../shared-library
ast-index update                 # or: ast-index rebuild
ast-index subtree list
```

Use `--subtree shared` to query only that attachment and `--local` to query
only the primary project. The legacy root commands remain compatibility
aliases; new automation should use `subtree add/remove/list`.

## AI Agent Integration

### Claude Code Plugin

```bash
# Option 1: via marketplace
claude plugin marketplace add defendend/Claude-ast-index-search
claude plugin install ast-index

# Option 2: if ast-index is already installed
ast-index install-claude-plugin
```

Restart Claude Code to activate.

Update: `brew upgrade ast-index && claude plugin update ast-index`.
Uninstall: `claude plugin uninstall ast-index`.

The Claude plugin ships `/initialize` as the default setup command. It
auto-detects project stack(s), including KMP and polyglot repos, then writes
`.claude/settings.json` and `.claude/rules/ast-index.md`. Use
`/initialize-android`, `/initialize-ios`, `/initialize-web`, `/initialize-rust`,
`/initialize-csharp`, or `/initialize-ruby` only as manual overrides.

See [`examples/.claude/rules/ast-index.md`](examples/.claude/rules/ast-index.md)
for a template rules file that teaches the agent to use ast-index for
structural navigation, outline before reading large files, and pass the same
instructions to subagents. Adapt before dropping into your project's
`.claude/rules/`.

### Codex Skill / Plugin

Codex can use the shared `ast-index` skill directly. For local development,
symlink or copy the skill directory into Codex's global skills directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
ln -s /absolute/path/to/Claude-ast-index-search/plugin/skills/ast-index ~/.codex/skills/ast-index
```

This repository also includes a Codex plugin manifest at
[`plugin/.codex-plugin/plugin.json`](plugin/.codex-plugin/plugin.json) and a
repo marketplace at [`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`](.agents/plugins/marketplace.json)
for Codex builds that support plugin marketplaces.

If your Codex build supports plugin marketplaces, restart Codex in this repo
and install `ast-index` from the repo marketplace. For a remote marketplace,
add the repository:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add defendend/Claude-ast-index-search
```

The Codex package exposes the same `ast-index` skill. Command-style project
setup is kept out of the Codex manifest because Codex uses skills and local
project configuration as first-class components.

### Cursor Skill / Plugin

Cursor can use the shared skill directly:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/skills
ln -s /absolute/path/to/Claude-ast-index-search/plugin/skills/ast-index ~/.cursor/skills/ast-index
```

This repository also includes a Cursor plugin manifest at
[`plugin/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`](plugin/.cursor-plugin/plugin.json) and a
multi-plugin marketplace at [`.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`](.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json).

For local Cursor testing:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/plugins/local
ln -s /absolute/path/to/Claude-ast-index-search/plugin ~/.cursor/plugins/local/ast-index
```

Reload Cursor after creating the symlink. The Cursor plugin package exposes the
shared `ast-index` skill, a project rule in `plugin/rules/`, and a Cursor-specific
`initialize-ast-index` command that writes `.cursor/rules/ast-index.mdc`.

### OpenCode 2 Plugin

The [OpenCode integration](plugin/opencode/README.md) includes a native
JavaScript plugin, the shared `ast-index` skill, and `/initialize-ast-index`.
It refreshes existing indexes on startup and after edits, respects an active
watcher, and guides structural searches toward `ast-index`.

Follow the [local installation instructions](plugin/opencode/README.md#install-from-this-checkout)
to link or copy the three components into OpenCode's global configuration or
a project's `.opencode` directory. No plugin build step is needed.

### Gemini CLI

```bash
gemini skills install https://github.com/defendend/Claude-ast-index-search.git --path plugin/skills/ast-index
```

## Commands (47+)

Run `ast-index rebuild` once per project, then use `ast-index update` to keep
the index fresh.

```bash
ast-index explore <QUERY...>       # One-shot context: ranked source + neighbours + tests (--rwr for graph)
ast-index search <QUERY>           # Universal structural search
ast-index file <PATTERN>           # Find files
ast-index symbol <NAME>            # Find symbols
ast-index class <NAME>             # Find classes/interfaces
ast-index outline <FILE>           # Symbols in file
ast-index imports <FILE>           # Imports in file
ast-index refs <SYMBOL>            # Definitions + imports + usages
ast-index usages <SYMBOL>          # Symbol usages
ast-index callers <FUNCTION>       # Function call sites
ast-index implementations <PARENT> # Find implementations
ast-index hierarchy <CLASS>        # Class hierarchy tree
ast-index changed [--base BRANCH]  # Branch-level changed files (A/M/D/R)
ast-index todo [PATTERN]           # TODO/FIXME/HACK comments
ast-index deprecated [QUERY]       # Deprecated items
```

### Paginated JSON schema v2

Limited search commands now report completeness explicitly. `symbol`, `class`,
`implementations`, `usages`, and `callers` use this shape:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "items": [],
  "pagination": {
    "total": 0,
    "returned": 0,
    "truncated": false,
    "limit": 50
  }
}
```

`search` and `refs` keep their named result arrays and provide one pagination
object per array under `pagination`. Consumers migrating from bare arrays must
read `items` for single-result-set commands and must check `truncated` before
treating a response as complete. This is limit-based pagination, not a cursor:
rerun with a larger `--limit` when more results are required.

The cache-independent `changed` command retains its separate JSON schema v1;
its schema version did not change with this pagination migration.

### Changed files on the current branch

`changed` asks the detected version-control repository for the files changed from
`merge-base(base, HEAD)` to `HEAD`. Without `--base`, Git resolves
`origin/HEAD`, then tries `origin/main`, `origin/master`, `main`, `master`, and
`trunk`; other supported backends select their conventional mainline. It reads
version-control state directly, so it works without an
ast-index database and does not require `rebuild` or `update`. Results are
scoped to the current working directory, while paths remain
repository-relative. Staged and unstaged working-tree edits are not included.

```bash
# Compact text summary
ast-index changed

# Stable schema v1; the VCS timeout defaults to 30000 ms
ast-index --format json changed --base origin/main --timeout-ms 30000

# Print the detected root, scope, exact VCS argv, and timing to stderr
ast-index changed --verbose
```

Text output uses `A` (added), `M` (modified), `D` (deleted), and `R` (renamed):

```text
Changed files against origin/main (3):
  M  README.md
  R  docs/old-guide.md -> docs/setup-guide.md
  M  docs/generated\nname.md
```

Control characters and backslashes in text paths are escaped, so every change
stays on one output line. Use JSON instead of parsing this human-readable
summary in scripts.

JSON output preserves rename metadata:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "vcs": "git",
  "base": "origin/main",
  "head": "HEAD",
  "scope": null,
  "changes": [
    { "status": "M", "path": "README.md" },
    { "status": "R", "path": "docs/setup-guide.md", "old_path": "docs/old-guide.md" }
  ]
}
```

At the repository root, `scope` is `null`; from a nested working directory it
is that repository-relative directory path.

This is a fast file summary for branch review, not a changed-symbol report and
not a replacement for your version-control system's diff command when patch
hunks are needed.

### Module analysis

```bash
ast-index module <PATTERN>         # Find modules
ast-index deps <MODULE>            # Module dependencies
ast-index dependents <MODULE>      # Dependent modules
ast-index unused-deps <MODULE>     # Find unused dependencies (v3.2: +transitive, XML, resources)
ast-index api <MODULE>             # Public API of module
```

#### module-route — dependency path between two modules

Show how module A reaches module B through the dependency graph:

```bash
# Shortest path (default)
ast-index module-route --from core.utils --to features.payments.api

# All simple paths, filtered to api edges only
ast-index module-route --from app --to core.db --all --via-kind api

# JSON output — machine-readable, no ANSI
ast-index module-route --from app --to core.db --format json

# Mermaid diagram (paste into any markdown renderer)
ast-index module-route --from app --to core.db --format mermaid

# Graphviz DOT
ast-index module-route --from app --to core.db --format dot

# Gradle-style module names work too
ast-index module-route --from :app --to :core:utils
```

Options:
- `--all` — return all simple paths instead of the single shortest
- `--via-kind <api|implementation|all>` — filter traversal to one edge kind (default: `all`)
- `--max-paths <N>` — cap on returned paths when `--all` is set (default: 50)
- `--max-depth <N>` — cap on path length in hops (default: 20)
- `--timeout-ms <N>` — wall-clock guard in milliseconds (default: 5000)

### XML & Resource analysis

```bash
ast-index xml-usages <CLASS>       # Find class usages in XML layouts
ast-index resource-usages <RES>    # Find resource usages (@drawable/ic_name, R.string.x)
ast-index resource-usages --unused --module <MODULE>  # Find unused resources
```

### iOS-specific commands

```bash
ast-index storyboard-usages <CLASS>  # Class usages in storyboards/xibs
ast-index asset-usages [ASSET]       # iOS asset usages (xcassets)
ast-index asset-usages --unused --module <MODULE>  # Find unused assets
ast-index swiftui [QUERY]            # @State/@Binding/@Published props
ast-index async-funcs [QUERY]        # Swift async functions
ast-index publishers [QUERY]         # Combine publishers
ast-index main-actor [QUERY]         # @MainActor usages
```

### Perl-specific commands

```bash
ast-index perl-exports [QUERY]       # Find @EXPORT/@EXPORT_OK
ast-index perl-subs [QUERY]          # Find subroutines
ast-index perl-pod [QUERY]           # Find POD documentation (=head1, =item, etc.)
ast-index perl-tests [QUERY]         # Find Test::More assertions (ok, is, like, etc.)
ast-index perl-imports [QUERY]       # Find use/require statements
```

### Index management

```bash
ast-index init                     # Initialize DB
ast-index rebuild [--type TYPE]    # Full reindex
ast-index update                   # Incremental update
ast-index stats                    # Index statistics
ast-index version                  # Version info
```

## Configuration File

Create `.ast-index.yaml` in your project root to configure ast-index:

```yaml
# Additional directories to index
roots:
  - "../shared-lib"
  - "../common-modules"

# Directories to exclude from indexing
exclude:
  - "vendor"
  - "build"
  - "node_modules"

# Include files ignored by .gitignore
no_ignore: false
```

All fields are optional. CLI flags override config file values.

### Examples

**Monorepo with shared libraries:**
```yaml
roots:
  - "../core"
  - "../network"
```

**Project with generated code to skip:**
```yaml
exclude:
  - "generated"
  - "proto/gen"
```

## Changelog

### 3.53.0

- **`search` no longer returns nothing for a multi-word query** — when a
  query with two or more terms has no literal match, `search` now hands it to
  the `explore` ranking engine and prints relevance-ranked symbols with their
  source, honouring `--module` / `--in-file`. Text output is labelled
  `No literal matches …`; JSON stays a single document and carries
  `"fallback": "explore"` plus a `reason`. Single-term queries keep exact
  literal semantics.
- **`callers` walks attached subtrees** — call sites inside a subtree added
  with `subtree add` are found and shown as `[name] /abs/path`, matching
  `usages` and `refs`. `--subtree NAME` restricts to that subtree, `--local`
  to the primary root. Previously both flags were accepted and ignored.
- **`explore` accepts scope** — `--module` / `--in-file` narrow the candidate
  set before ranking.
- **Agent guidance points intent queries at `explore`** — the skill and the
  MCP `search` description now say to use `explore` for a question or a
  description and `search` for a known identifier.

### 3.52.0

- **Index C++ functions that return a pointer or a reference** — declarations
  such as `Grid* GetGrid()`, `Player& FindPlayer()`, and
  `const Grid* const GetEmptyPhaseShift()` are now indexed instead of being
  skipped.
- **Install from crates.io** — the installation guide now documents
  `cargo install ast-index --locked` as the released channel, with the Git
  build kept as the way to install the unreleased default branch.

### 3.51.0

- **Report truncated search results instead of hiding them** — `search`,
  `symbol`, `class`, `implementations`, `refs`, `usages`, and `callers` now
  print `showing N of M` with a `--limit` hint, and emit paginated JSON
  schema v2 with `total`, `returned`, `truncated`, and `limit`.
- **Keep the index fresh without blocking edits** — `update --background
  --debounce-ms <ms>` queues a coordinated, trailing-debounced generation and
  returns immediately; index-reading commands wait for a queued generation
  instead of answering from a stale index.
- **Scope watcher detection to the project** — the new `watch-status` command
  reports whether this project has an active watcher, so a watcher in one
  repository no longer suppresses updates in another. Session-start and
  post-edit hooks and the generated Git hooks use it, and the session-start
  hook now runs asynchronously with a visible status message.
- **Index Kotlin files containing `suspend { }` lambdas** — a suspend-lambda
  syntax error no longer drops the enclosing interface, nested classes, and
  later declarations from the index, and local `val` bindings are no longer
  published as properties.
- **Count Kotlin references accurately** — references in a symbol's own
  declaring file are kept when external references exist, and matches inside
  string literals, comments, and KDoc are excluded while executable string
  interpolation is still indexed.
- **Resolve kebab-case Gradle type-safe project accessors** — `deps`,
  `dependents`, `unused-deps`, and `module-route` now link
  `projects.core.designIcon` to `:core:design-icon`, and report ambiguity
  instead of picking an arbitrary module.
- **Rebuild on Windows** — the staged index is synced through a
  write-capable handle, fixing `failed to sync index file … (os error 5)`.
  Concurrent runs are also recognized as ordinary lock contention instead of
  failing with `failed to acquire index publication lock … (os error 33)`.
- **Detect nested project stacks** — `detect-stacks` performs a bounded
  recursive marker scan and recognizes standard nested Kotlin Multiplatform
  layouts such as `composeApp/src/commonMain`.
- **Document worktrees and cross-root workspaces** — independent git
  worktrees keep independent indexes; intentional workspaces are attached
  with `rebuild`, then `subtree add`, then `update`.
- **Compare ast-index and CodeGraph** — `docs/comparison.md` adds a dated,
  source-backed feature comparison with pinned snapshots of both projects.

### 3.50.0

- **Review branch changes quickly without building an index** — use `changed`
  from the CLI or MCP to read cache-independent branch changes with
  added, modified, deleted, and renamed files, rename metadata,
  working-directory scope, a bounded VCS timeout, Git base auto-detection, and
  stable JSON schema v1.
- **Migrate `changed` consumers to the file-level contract** — text output now
  prints an A/M/D/R file summary instead of regex-derived declaration
  pseudo-symbols. Scripts should request `--format json` and read
  `changes[].status`, `changes[].path`, and `changes[].old_path` for renames.
  Library callers can use the deprecated Rust compatibility wrappers while
  migrating to the new API.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for earlier releases.
